> Create a method that receives as input parameter the root node of a liked list and deletes the nodes with
> values that are repeated more than 2 times. Each node contains a character value from ‘A’ to ‘Z’. The
> nodes in the list can come in any random order. You need to preserve the original order of the nodes.
